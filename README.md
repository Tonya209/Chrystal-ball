# Magic Ball
Do you want to know if your day will be lucky today? This program is based on a fortune teller´s crystal ball. You´re asked to choose a number from 1 t0 7 and then the ball tells you a prediction for the day. This program is written in Java and it uses a Scanner, a switch statement, exceptions handling and a do-while loop.
